#ðŸ”— Doubly Linked List Implementation
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Doubly Linked List in [your programming language, e.g., Python/C++/Java]. A doubly linked list is a dynamic data structure where each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes, allowing efficient insertion and deletion from both ends.

âœ… Features:
Node creation and insertion (beginning, end, specific position)

Deletion (beginning, end, specific node)

Forward and backward traversal

Search functionality

Reversal of the list

Clean, modular, and well-commented code

ðŸ“Œ Ideal For:
Learning and understanding how doubly linked lists work

Practicing basic data structures

Academic use and interview preparation
